Over-Under

This is a dice based game in which 2 users play against each other on the same device.

Rules: 
  - Player one and player 2 will roll, either by shaking or pressing the roll button, on alternate turns
  - The number displayed next to "Your number is: " is the over/under for you to predict. This number ranges between 8 and 34
  - "much higher" and "much lower" refer to the extreme 50% on either side of the target number
  - If you guess equal, you will get 75 points and if you guess other options correctly you will get points inversely proportional to the probability of outcome
  - First player to 200 wins
